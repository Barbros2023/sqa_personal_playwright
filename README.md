## 📖 Story: Overcoming Hurdles
At first, Playwright’s **browser dependency downloads** caused a lot of problems in CI.  
I tried multiple approaches. here's the simple stories:

### 1️⃣ Old DriverFactory #1
*“Okay Playwright, you do your thing.”*  
- Relied on Playwright to auto-download browsers.  
- 💔 Failed due to network instability and dependency problem (timeouts, `ECONNRESET`).  

### 2️⃣ Old DriverFactory #2 (Over-engineering Attempt)
*“I don’t trust Playwright, let me control everything myself.”*  
- Forced **Google Chrome executable path** manually.  
- Tried to bypass Playwright’s managed Chromium.  
- Mixed Selenium-style setup with Playwright logic.  
- Added redundant flags like `--no-sandbox`, etc.  
- 💔 Broke things worse:  
  - Mismatched browser versions (Playwright expected build 1140, system had build 1187).  
  - Added complexity without solving the root cause (network + dependency mismatch).
  - I haven't realize the dependency problem yet  

### 3️⃣ New DriverFactory (Final)
*“Okay Playwright, you do your thing (again).”*  
- Returned to Playwright’s **default browser management**.  
- Trusted Playwright to handle binaries & drivers.  
- Only added **headless mode** and CI-friendly flags.  
- 💚 Smooth run:  
  - Fixed dependency issues. Randomly tries another playwright dependency.
  - Simplified the code.  
  - Stable in local and GitHub Actions.
